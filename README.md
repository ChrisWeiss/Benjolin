I used a combination of Kweiwen's schematic on his github as well as the electro-music schematics. I then added the power supply and protection.

The main issue (which is an original feature) for me is that the output volume is quite low. This is true of the original design. You can adjust one of the resistors just before the filter to boost the gain. But this can cause subtle distortion in the filter. If I ever revise the board Iâ€™ll add an output gain cell. It doesnt bother me much on this version - but just be aware of it....
